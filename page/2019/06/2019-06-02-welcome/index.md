I offer here data visualizations that I've created for my Introduction to Data Visualization and Design class. I've chosen to display my work on pages rather than posts to allow the visualizations greater digital real estate. I welcome feedback, so please [email me](khammond@gradcenter.cuny.edu) with any suggestions.
